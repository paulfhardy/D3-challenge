# D3-challenge

## Please Note:

### 1. Data Points:

A plot of Smokers(%) vs Age (Median) was plotted for each state.
* Data was plotted for all states in the dataset.
* A circle was used to represent each data point.
* Each circle contains the two letter abbreviation for the state that it represents. 
* The abbreviation fits within the circumference of the circle.

* A screen shot of the plot appears below:

### 2. Axes:

* Titles were added to both the x and y axes.
* Ticks were spaced out using a linear function on both axes
* The axes were scales so as to spread out the data to minimize overlap as much as possible, while not losing any data points. (Some overlap was unavoidable).


### 3. Bonus:

* From the bonus section, tool tips were added to the data points that include:

  1. Full state name.
  2. Selected x axis variable. Age (Median)
  3. Selected y axis variable. Smokers (%)
  4. Selected Data point gains a border when hovered over & also changes color for better clarity.
